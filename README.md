# Maze Generator and Solver

This project is a Python application that generates a random maze using the `tkinter` library and solves it using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The application provides a visual representation of the maze generation and solving process, making it an excellent tool for understanding maze algorithms and pathfinding techniques.

## Features

- Random maze generation using `tkinter`.
- Maze solving using the Depth-First Search algorithm.
- Visual representation of the maze and the solving process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the main Python script to generate and solve a maze.
3. Watch the visual representation of the maze generation and solving process.

## TODOs

- Add Breath-First Search (BFS) and A*.
- Add command line inputs determining maze size and search algorithm.
- Add a timer showing how long it takes the algorithm to solve the maze.
